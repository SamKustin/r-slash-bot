# r_slash_bot
A twitter bot which reads reddit posts and posts them to twitter @r_slash_bot

Currently, this bot tweets the top posts from r/aww every 10 minutes.

This bot was created using Python. However, it does not run 24/7.
Instead, the program must be run through terminal and kept in the background.

**Notes:**
* In future implementations, I would like to allow users to mention @r_slash_bot
in their own tweet and specify a different subreddit or post number from 1-25.
Then, @r_slash_bot would reply to the user with the post they specified.
